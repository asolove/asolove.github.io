        <h2>I believe order can't be planned, only allowed to grow</h2>
      </header>
      <p>When applied to different aspects of my work, this means:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Leadership</strong> is primarily about listening to people and systems, then gently experimenting with changes to let them naturally reach their potential.</li>
        <li><strong>User interface design</strong> starts with building less, designing in the browser, and using the right words. Plus most of the rest of what Basecamp have published.</li>
        <li><strong>Engineering</strong> teams should focus on powering learning, not delivering lists of features.</li>

          Principal Engineer & Tech Lead,<br>
          Vistaprint Digital Marketing Products</h3>
        <p>I led three teams with responsibility for a portfolio of products and building a new, service-oriented architecture to replace a legacy product framework.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>As lead of the <a href="http://www.pagemodo.com/">Pagemodo</a> and <a href="http://www.vistaprint.com/facebook-business-page-builder.aspx">Vistaprint Social</a> products, helped the team to change its process and priorities. The team's new customer- and metrics-focused way of working doubled conversion rates in our main purchase funnel, improved onboarding to double first-day feature usage, and made core product changes that increased return usage by 500%.</li>
          <li>As a leader, I poked the organization towards several other changes: championing the adoption of React so our UIs were more testable, building powerful new analytics to guide decisions where we had previously guessed, and conducting the company's first paper prototyping and user experience research.</li>

        <h3>Founder, Snowdrop <time>2015</time></h3>
        <p>Our family has struggled with post-partum depression for several years. Through the recovery, we learned that while medication and therapy play an important role, we also had to develop new habits and ways of thinking. Currently in a private beta, Snowdrop is a mobile webapp that helps other families to develop those habits. It's built in Rails and uses the Twilio API.</p>

        <h3>Webmaster, The Millennial Experience Mobile Exhibit <time>2015</time></h3>
        <aside>
          <a href="http://www.themillennialexperience.org/it/title-panel/"><img src="/img/me.png" width="100%"></a>
          <p>View the <a href="http://www.themillennialexperience.org/it/title-panel/"> archived site</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/millennial_one">some of the resulting responses.</a></p>
        </aside>
        <p>I built a mobile website to accompany this exhibit of millennials' existential questions for Europe's largest summer festival, the Meeting at Rimini. With such an enormous audience, mostly using old Android phones on an over-crowded cell network, the site needed to be very fast. But it also needed to be fast to build and update in several languages, because the content was only available two weeks before the exhibition began, and then changed rapidly.</p>
        <p>I used React as the site's foundation, allowing me to use react-intl for localization and the full power of JavaScript to generate reusable content components. But the production site could be generated once and served incredibly fast from cacheable static HTML files with resources inlined.</p>

        <h3>Constraint programming talk, JSConf <time>2013</time></h3>

        </aside>
        <p>I am very interested in how computers can extend rather than replace human decision-making. Most user interfaces today rely on humans to provide input but then allow computers to carry our decisionmaking logic. Constraint programming is one model in which human input and computer logic can coexist to extend the limits of human thinking. In this talk, I explained the basics of constraint programming, show several basic examples, and speculate on the future of constraint interfaces.</p>

      <h3>Smallest federated wiki <time>2011</time></h3>

      </aside>
      <p>Ward Cunningham, the inventor of the wiki, is now exploring a major change to the idea, using a decentralized editing model similar to git. His project, Smallest federated wiki, had a solid API and a great interface concept, but some of the details of getting it to work in the browser had proved difficult to implement. I contributed my browser knowledge, starting with this browser history, animations, and scrolling work. My work made the interface more fluid and intuitive.</p>

    <p>For several years I worked as a freelancer doing typesetting, web design, and development work for various clients. During that time I developed a strong distrust for my clients' descriptions of what they wanted. It was only when we got to visual representations that their opinions began to be consistent. Deco was an experimental online moodboarding tool where clients and I could work together to look for inspiration and agree on the meanings of the words they used.</p>
    <p>Built in 2010, Deco was a very early experiment in using Node.js, websockets, the html5 File API, and multitouch events.</p>

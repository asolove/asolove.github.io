# Adam's personal site

## How it works

For local development, you need [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/):

- basic developer setup (make, gcc, g++)
- ruby: >2.5 and rubygems
- `gem install jekyll`

Then you can [build the site locally](https://gitdocs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll):

- `jekyll serve`

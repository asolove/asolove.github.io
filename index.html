<h3>About</h3>

<p><strong>I lead teams that build magical web software.</strong> My sharpest weapons are 
  JavaScript, SQL, and the Apple Pencil.</p>
<p>I am taking a summer sabbatical to contribute to <a href="https://github.com/asolove">open source</a>, go to the pool with my family, and look out for what's next. If you have an interesting problem that I can help solve, please <a href="mailto:asolove@gmail.com">get in touch.</a></p>

<h3>Current projects</h3>

  <p>I'm currently learning <a href="http://facebook.github.io/reason/">Reason</a> and exploring how types and other formal methods can help simplify the complexity that makes UIs so hard to build.</p>
    
<h3>Previous projects</h3>

<p>I've studied the history of UI programming and the powerful models behind revolutionary interfaces. From 2012 to 2016 my personal studies centered on constraint programming as a way to build user interfaces that blur the distinction between input and output.</p>

<dl class="current-projects">
  <dt><a href="https://github.com/asolove/microScopeKanren">MicroScopeKanren</a></dt>
  <dd>Reimplementing the microKanren constraint solver in JavaScript, then experimenting with ways to visualize how the solver works.</dd>
  
  <dt><a href="https://github.com/asolove/Sketchpad">Sketchpad</a></dt>
  <dd>Recreating Ivan Sutherland's Sketchpad, the 
    first graphical user interface, in ClojureScript. (Paused because I need to learn more Clojure and math.)</dd>
    
  <dt><a href="https://github.com/asolove/scrubbing-budget">Scrubbing budget</a> <span class="in progress"></span></dt>
  <dd>An experiment in contraint-based user interfaces. This visualization of the US Federal Budget lets you explore questions like: "how much would we have to raise taxes in order to increase education spending?" or "how much could we cut the deficit by raising the retirement age for social security?"</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://github.com/asolove/scrubbing-linear-calculator">Scrubbing linear calculator</a></dt>
  <dd>Creating a small part of Bret Victor's scrubbing calculator with a linear constraint solver.</dl>

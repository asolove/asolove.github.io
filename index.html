<h3>About me</h3>

<p>I'm a web developer at <a href="http://www.webs.com">Webs</a>, where I build web applications
  that help small businesses get online. I live right outside Washington, DC.</p>

<h3>Current projects</h3>

<p>I'm exploring the history of UI programming and the powerful models behind revolutionary interfaces. My current projects center on constraint programming as a way to build user interfaces that blur the distinction between input and output.</p>

<span class="pull">[!!con](https://bangbangcon.com/) <del>is</del> _was_ a conference dedicated to the joy, excitement, and surprise of computing. The final event was last weekend. I went, met folks, presented a talk, and had some big feelings.</span>

<div class="aside">

<p><strong>Foreword from tomorrow</strong></p>
<p>Last night, I got very high (I have a prescription, don't @ me), spent time with my big feelings on tech, and drafted this essay. This morning, I reread it and found it to be long, incoherent, and heart-achingly earnest. I cleaned it up just a bit.</p>
<p>Canonically, the right way to read this post is:</p>
<ul>
<li>take an appropriate dose of your local hallucinogen or psychedelic</li>
<li>put on a copy of <a href="https://www.discogs.com/master/1280986-Tom-Rogerson-With-Brian-Eno-Finding-Shore">Finding Shore</a> by Tom Rogerson and Brian Eno</li>
<li>settle in for some terribly prosy prose that you can just scroll through to get to the parts you care about</li>
</ul>

## On !!con

Note: I don't really know the history of !!con and I don't plan to do any research.

I heard about the conference first via [Julia](https://jvns.ca/), an awesome human being whom I very much admire. I know a few other people who have gone or presented, mostly in the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) milieu, and have watched many of the previous talks over the years.

If I think about the gradient you descend among my connections that takes you most strongly in the direction of !!con, it is radical curiosity, inclusivity, and weirdness.

Construct a graph:

- "be gay" is the x axis
- "do crime" is the y-axis
- "with tech" is the z-axis

and !!con is located quite far in the +++ quadrant.

## On the city

<a href="/img/bangbang/river.jpeg"><img class="right" alt="Landscape photo of geese swimming in a river with hills amid the sunset" src="/img/bangbang/river.jpeg" id="river"></a>

!!con 2024 is located in a place that I originally couldn't remember the name of.

I'm very clear that it starts with a San, but I can't remember which godblessed saint it is. I think it starts with a C. In the weeks leading up to the event, I tell various people that it's in "Santa Clara", "San Clemente", and _empty stare, realizing I need to double-check my transit plans_.

It turns out after spending a few days there it's Santa Cruz. I can now remember this city's name, and the eponymous UC school, thanks to spending time here at !!con. UCSC's mascot is the banana slug and if you meet UCSC people [they](https://www.filmgarb.com/vincent-vegas-uc-santa-cruz-shirt/) [will](https://www.ucsc.edu/campus/mascot/) [tell](https://news.ucsc.edu/2011/06/banana-slug-25th-anniversary.html) [you](https://news.ucsc.edu/2008/02/1933.html) [about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIO7S2jVtjQ) [it](https://youtu.be/cIO7S2jVtjQ?si=97dPipIeCxLeXOx-&t=168)!

Various people tell me, during my time in Santa Cruz, that it isn't a particularly safe city and I should be careful. As a 6'5" white man who appears imposing (fact check: but is not) my judgement on this matter can't be trusted but I definitely walked through dark places at dark times of night and enjoyed it.

The Santa Cruz food scene is pretty strong.

- I did order the same burrito from [the same place](https://soquelave.taqueriasantacruz.com/) twice: they call it a 49ers burrito, because it comes smothered in red sauce and yellow cheese. One of the times they forgot my sour cream and guacamole, but it was still good. So I went back and actually got the toppings the second time and it was even better.
- I do not recommend [the chicken sandwich place](https://www.flashbirdchicken.com/). Maybe it's just that I'm from Atlanta and it would be dangerous to sell a chicken sandwich this dry in a state with concealed carry laws. This sandwich is _fine_ for like a grocery store or a bar, but if your deal is "chicken sandwich place", it is not really good enough.
- You do have to stop at [both](http://www.mariannesicecream.com/) [of the](http://www.thepennyicecreamery.com/) local ice cream places. Before trying them, I asked people which one was better and got confusing answers. I now understand. They are two orthogonal axes of ice cream and there are appropriate orders that are better at each.

<img alt="CineLux theater sign: No app required, mobile friendly. Now serving Coppola wine, Sabe cocktails" src="/img/bangbang/theater.jpeg" class="right">

I also recommend the [17 bus](https://www.scmtd.com/en/routes/20192/17/wd_ob). There was a Discord channel full of people asking for rides to Santa Cruz from elsewhere. But the only real way to do this is to take Bart to Caltrain to the 17 bus.

- You will sit next to people of other classes, species, and planes of reality.
- You will pass the movie theater that promises you don't need an app because their website is mobile-friendly.
- You will wish you got off the bus to buy a ticket to a movie. A movie theater that advertises that you don't need an app, and that they sell wine, rather than what movies are showing, will necessarily be showing better movies, movies that possibly don't exist at other movie theaters.

## On the venue and setup

<img src="/img/bangbang/deer.jpeg" alt="A deer hanging out in the grass, amid a small parking lot and redwood trees on campus" class="right">

I ride the bus up to what I expect to be a campus, like with a quad?, but UCSC is more of a "campusing", a living process of becoming a campus. There are some very cool construction sites along the way. The bus goes through a barren field (later, I learn this is a fire break! But it's located between the campus and the ocean, so are we worried that the fire is possibly coming from the ocean: "then one day, the fire ocean attacked"?) and then enters a forest of redwoods.

Each building has a bus stop, a long ways away from other buildings, with forest inbetween. The ewoks have started a college and we might swing from tree to tree to get to the next class. (Later, I learn that there's a real problem at UCSC where your class can get moved to another building after registration and you literally have to hike or bus through the woods fast enough to get there.)

The bus drops me off at what appears to just be a small path through the woods, at a right angle to the bus route. A few other people got off at the same bus stop, and one of them has gradient hair, which is a good sign that I may have found my people. She introduces herself as [Dawn](https://post.lurk.org/@dcwalk).

We find a deer and then an intelligent and extremely imposing raven, then walk a path through the trees, between the dumpsters and generators that are clearly the backs of buildings, to a courtyard with the many folding chairs that tell us we have reached the conference. (Later, we will find out we just got off a stop too soon, but in retrospect arriving this way was very appropriate.)

## Day 1

### The morning

I'm going to be honest, I don't have a lot of memories of this morning. I sit myself down away from everyone because I am crazy nervous for my talk. A few people nevertheless recognize me and come say hi. 👋 If any of you are now reading this, I apologize for what must have been very bizarre social interactions with me. My brain was nowhere near my body during that time, as it had ejected back at my hotel and was still rehearsing my talk and thinking about ways my live demo could go wrong.

The conference started. My brain was still mostly elsewhere.

- Dawn's talk was delightful and made me want to buy some hardware, make some friends in my neighborhood, and build something together.
- Nicole gave a talk on programming with exceptions that was hilarious.
- By Amédée's talk, I am completely outside of space and time.
- I remembering thinking "wait, I think I've met Jes before" but don't remember being physically present for the talk about making a modern astrolabe. (I went back and watched the archived livestream and wow this was such a cool talk!)
- I ate lunch in a bubble by myself, still incapable of forming coherent words that aren't just my talk.

### My talk and the second session

As the second session, the one I was speaking in, got started, I was again sitting by myself. Lindsay sat down near me and made some kind of smalltalk that I've now forgotten. (I assume that at this point I looked out of my head and she was trying to calm me down without just saying that. If so: it worked and thanks!)

Then: I gave my talk! I have limited memory of this. (I watched the streamed version of it. There are several very funny and poignant sentences in there that I never rehearsed and have no direct memory of saying! It seems from my out-of-body-experience to have gone pretty well?!?)

After I got off the stage, I remember vaguely wandering around to get some water and being really impresseed with the text talk, making images from a typewriter.

My memory resumes again right at the start of...

### The third session

Taylor's song.
Huggable data
Keyboarding
The perfect blend

It's hot. Everyone has migrated to shade: umbrellas, trees, the covered mezzanine (this was secretly the best spot), or under the eaves of the buildings.

### Unconferencing and meeting people

It's unconferencing time! I decided that walking up to people who already proposed topics might be weird, so I'll just stand around and see if anyone voluntarily comes up to talk to me about stuff I talked about. And they do!

- I run into Franklin, who I used to work with at Stripe. This is, we think, the first time we've ever been together in person. We catch up and talk about the state of tech.
- We both run into [Omar](https://omar.website/), who I followed and interacted with a lot back in the good old days of twitter. Omar is sorta a hero of mine. He worked on [Dynamicland](https://dynamicland.org/) and built [Geokit](https://omar.website/posts/notes-from-dynamicland-geokit/). Geokit is the kind of software I would like to make. It's a completely different medium from the kind of software I actually make and I am jealous and in awe of him. But he comes by to chat after my talk and before his talk. He's now working on [Folk Computer](https://folk.computer/), which extends the idea of spatial computing.
- A UCSC student comes up and asks us about [ZUIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooming_user_interface) and grid-based UIs. Omar and I are happy to provide names and paper titles for him to read. It seems like he wants more form us. I think he has a beautiful idea in which the domain objects in the GUI are actually located physically in space, rather than just being "laid out" in space arbitrarily as part of UI design. He is asking us for advice, or suggestions, or what angle to explore. But we are just UI people in our 30s who have mostly lived through trying things and some very bad industry norms on UI decisions. I wish I could convince him that he should be asking older people or just trying things himself.

### Session 4

- Omar's talk on making hardware
- Yufeng on indexing Google Streetview photos of Brooklyn
- Matias and bit-flipping (seeing him at the hotel later). Later, I see him at the hotel and ask to see the memory address written on his hand. He obliges. He also has a great freeze-frame of the moment at the beginning of his talk where he finds out hi slides aren't showing because he has plugged in a cable that isn't actually plugged in to anything else. He loves this and is showing it to people. More speakers should have this level of self-meme-ization.

### Evening 1, after the conference

At the end of day 1, I wanted to see more of the redwoods behind campus, so I post on Discord that I am going to go on a hike, leaving from the top of the steps, and would welcome company.

<span class="aside">Hey fellow neurodivergent friends, here's your fun tip for the day: if you want social company but feel awkard, consider just [superliminally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaRctjOh9ho) posting your intentions. That way, people can opt in to be part of it, and they'll walk up to you and say something like "you you here for the hike?", and the ones who do will likely be socially-awkard people like you looking for a safe activity to meet new people.</span>

Several folks joined in, and as a result:

- I met Jonathan, who is researching a better notion of time to replace Lamport clocks in a way that makes them more useful for computer-aided proofs.
- I met Patrick, who is working on a Lisp-flavored linearly-typed language that was pitched as "cutting functional programming off at the knees". All side effects are covered by linear typing, and then it can be compiled efficiently and make raw syscalls without C interop. You will not be shocked to learn that he also has a hacked remarkable tablet that he boots into a shell and writes code in vim. This seems like a fever dream that the ketamine invented but I think it's a real thing and there's a chance it might change everything [Wadler paper].
- I met [Blinry](https://blinry.org/), who is visiting all the way from Europe and has a talk coming up tomorrow. They are also working on some very interesting distributed UI problems that I'd love to learn more about.

From the taco place, I walked back to the hotel and, exhausted, immediately fell asleep.

## Day 2

I woke up on day 2 and was immediately not feeling great. I've been testing regularly and don't have covid, but feel pretty gross. I went to the venue for a while, but continued to not feel good, and so retired back to the hotel during the morning, to watch things online. The good news is the stream is mostly working (and when not working, it is _engagingly_ not working, with the Discord audience and the on-site organizers playing a fun high-latency game of trying to improve the sound quality.)

## Afterwords

<img src="/img/bangbang/trees.jpg" class="right" alt="sunlight falling through high tree branches" />

The next morning, I am feeling a bit better and have a bit of time before leaving town, so I walk through [The Forest of Nisene Marks](https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=666), (check out this url! It's page #666 on the CA Parks Department) take some photos, and think.

I saw that this weekend was also [the final XOXO festival](https://xoxofest.com/2024/schedule/), another indie conference, which was synonymous with the last ten years of internet weirdness. The theme of XOXO this year was "komorebi" (木漏れ日), a Japanese word that describes the dappled quality of light that has fallen through tree leaves.

The quality of komorebi is the product of an entire healthy ecosystem. You can't have a light source that is itself dappled, nor east of Valinor can you have a tree that emits its own light. And for some light to pass between the trees to the forest floor requires [crown shyness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_shyness) or some other dynamic that prevents the tallest trees from completely crowding all the light.

It reminds me of Ursula Le Guin's essay [The Carrir Bag Theory of Fiction](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/mirror/u/uk/ursula-k-le-guin-the-carrier-bag-theory-of-fiction.pdf), which proposes the bag, rather than the spear, as the prototypical human tool. A spear is useful because of how it can impose your will on other living things. But the bag is useful because it holds space for other things, so that they can become something else, or come with us through time and space until they are needed.

Similarly, while there are parts of a community that are about changing the world and imposing our own ideas, the most important parts are about holding space for something new to come about, or for something from another place and time to become handy in a new context.

At various times, Twitter, !!, and XOXO have been important bags to hold open interesting spaces in my life. They are now gone. I think, nevertheless, that the forest of tech weirdness remains healthy. The loss of several of the tallest trees is a big change. But the extra light falling down to the forest floor is creating space for the growth of the next generation.

The next generation of our communities will be smaller, nimbler, more resilient, and more local. We'll need new ways to govern and steer these communities. As importantly, we'll need a different ethos, more interested in creating long-term community and change locally, rather than focusing on the louder-but-shallower praise on centralized internet services like Twitter or HN.

## After enlightenment, the laundry

It's time to start the work to build on the !! dream, and bring it to my own community:

- I went on Bluesky and Mastodon and searched for other indie tech folks in the Atlanta area, and met a few. (Are you nearby? [Get in touch](mailto:asolove+atl@gmail.com)). There's also a lot of cool folks up in Ellijay and I need to go meet them.
- I have a home server, but never got all my media set up locally. I should do that.
- I have the hardware to run a Folk computing instance, so I should set that up.
- Pyret
- D / Wasm / Spritely

<p class="abstract">This talk introduces the structure of React.js and tries to immerse you
in its philosophy. After watching it, you should be able to build a simple React app and use the online
documentation to learn more about the library.</p>

<p class="abstract">Part two covers Om, a ClojureScript library the wraps React
and also provides a model abstraction for using ClojureScript's immutable, persistent data structures to hold 
your app's data.</p>

I really enjoyed giving this talk and am thankful to Seth Schroeder of [CapClug](http://www.meetup.com/Cap-Clug/) for inviting me to speak
and to Gray Herter for inviting the [NovaRug](http://www.meetup.com/novarug/) group to come and for recording the talk and getting
it online so quickly.

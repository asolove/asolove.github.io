At [Fintech Devcon 2023](https://fintechdevcon.io/), I gave a talk on designing and building embedded UIs, based 
on my experiences contributing to Stripe Elements and then to Rainforest's embedded components.

I got some great comments and questions afterwords and wanted to started a broader conversation to bring together
engineers and product people working with `<iframe>`s.

To get involved, sign up for the [iframe-friends mailing list](https://buttondown.email/iframe-friends):

[Email me](mailto:asolove@gmail.com) if you have questions, topics you'd like to see discussed, or a request for 
review on your proposed new embedded UI.

I'll shortly be sending out further resources based on those questions as well as sharing an invite
for future group discussions.

## Slides

[<img class="right" src="/img/iframeable-finance2.jpg"/>You can download the slides as a pdf.](/img/iframeable-finance.pdf) although note that some of the 
diagrams have animations that won't work well statically and really need video to do them justice.

## Video

_The video isn't out yet, but I'll post here as soon as it's available._

## Thanks

I want to repeat what I said in the talk: while I have tried to gather together this information
and make it easily available to more people, I am not primarily responsible for having learned or
designed most of the things in this talk.

A huge thanks to the people who taught me or learned by 
my site, especially: Alex, Jenan, Michelle, David, and Tyler. You know who you are. I'm just trying
to pay it forward.

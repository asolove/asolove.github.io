tl;dr: a new report from our department of experimental linguistics suggests: **there are only 20 JavaScript runtimes left.**

## Context

The rule is: if you are building a new JavaScript runtime, its name must be a permutation of the letters in "Node". (See: Node, Deno, Endo.)

This blog post provides a scientific study of the possible runtimes, a ranking of them by brand name potential, and an estimate for when they will all be claimed.

## Already-claimed names

| Name                                   | Description                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [node](https://nodejs.org/en)          | The original: an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.                                           |
| [deno](https://deno.com/)              | Deno is the most productive, secure, and performant JavaScript runtime for the modern programmer.                      |
| [endo](https://github.com/endojs/endo) | A JavaScript platform ... for secure communication among objects ... distributed between mutually suspicious machines. |
| [deon](https://github.com/plurid/deon) | Not a JS runtime, but there is already a JSON-like notation format of this name, so we can't use this name             |

## Available names

That leaves us with 20 available permutations. Many of them would make quite poor names, so I've ranked them here in order by how strong I think the brand opportunity is.

**Plausible names**

| Name | Brand possibilities                                                                                                                       |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| oden | Strong mythology/comics reference possibilities here for logo branding.                                                                   |
| nedo | Pronounce it "Neato!"                                                                                                                     |
| edno | Pronounce it "Edna" and make this a Simpsons reference to Edna Krabappel and you've got a string brand and a cease-and-desist opportunity |     |
| doen | Pronounce it "Doin'"                                                                                                                      |

**Hard-to-use names**

<small>dneo
dnoe
edon
enod
eodn
eond
ndeo
ndoe
neod
noed
odne
oedn
oend
onde
oned
</small>

**An important point**

I hope the developer community will show some restaint and claim all of those 19 available permutations first.

Then, the final JavaScript runtime can claim the name `done`.

## Exhaustion estimate

We can do a quick curve-fitting exercise on the available data:

| Year | Runtimes | Event                     |
| ---- | -------- | ------------------------- |
| 2009 | 1        | Node first public release |
| 2018 | 2        | Deno first public release |
| 2019 | 3        | Endo first demo           |

To see that we can expect all 24 permutations to be claimed by 2029:

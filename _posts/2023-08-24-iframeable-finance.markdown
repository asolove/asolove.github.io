<img class="right" src="/img/iframeable-finance.jpg">
At [Fintech Devcon 2023](https://fintechdevcon.io/), I gave a talk on designing and building embedded UIs, based 
on my experiences contributing to Stripe Elements and then to Rainforest's embedded components.

I got some great comments and questions afterwords and wanted to start a broader conversation to bring together
engineers and product people working with `<iframe>`s.

## Slides

[<img class="right" src="/img/iframeable-finance2.jpg"/>You can download the slides as a pdf.](/img/iframeable-finance.pdf) although note that some of the
diagrams have animations that won't work well statically and really need video to do them justice.

## Thanks

I want to repeat what I said in the talk: while I have tried to gather together this information
and make it easily available to more people, I am not primarily responsible for having learned or designed most of the things in this talk.

A huge thanks to the people who taught me or learned together with me, especially: Alex, Jenan, Michelle, David, and Tyler. You know who you are. I'm just trying to pay it forward.

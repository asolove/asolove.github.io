<h3>About me</h3>

<p>I work on the <a href="http://pagemodo.com/">Pagemodo</a> team, building user interfaces on the web. 
I previously worked at <a href="http://montagestudio.com/">Montage</a>, exploring better ways to build 
user interfaces for the web. I live right outside Washington, DC.</p>

<h3>Current projects</h3>

<p>I'm currently focused on learning to be a better development team lead and understanding the business
  and marketing sides of the products that I build.</p>
  
<p>Technologically, I work in Rails and MVC JavaScript, and love to make things faster.
  I'm excited to become proficient in <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React.js</a>
  and apply some of the alternate UI models I've studied (see below) on the web.</p>

<h3>Previous projects</h3>

<p>I've studied the history of UI programming and the powerful models behind revolutionary interfaces. My current projects center on constraint programming as a way to build user interfaces that blur the distinction between input and output.</p>

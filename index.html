  <dt>Payments, especially embeddable UIs</dt>
  <dd>
    Since 2017, my primary professional work has been in building embedded UIs for payments, at <a href="stripe.com">Stripe</a> and now <a href="rainforestpay.com">Rainforest</a>.
    At Stripe, I was a contributor to 
      <a href="https://stripe.com/payments/elements">Elements</a>, 
      <a href="https://stripe.com/payments/checkout">Checkout</a>,
      <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/payment-api-design">the PaymentIntent API</a>,
      <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/european-payment-methods-available-worldwide">new payment methods</a>,
      <a href="https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication">PSD2/SCA/3DS2</a>, and the
      <a href="https://twitter.com/edwinwee/status/1141245532255313920">emoji collection</a>.
    I also contributed to the W3C's <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/04/19-wpwg-minutes">Web Payments Working Group</a> and the <a href="https://www.emvco.com/emv-technologies/3-d-secure/">EMVCo 3DS specification committee</a>,
    eventually serving as <a href="https://github.com/w3c/3ds/issues/2">a translator between them</a> to convince them to <a href="https://www.emvco.com/wp-content/uploads/news/EMVCo-FIDO-Alliance-W3C-Interest-Group-release_FINAL-website-version.pdf">actually work together</a>.

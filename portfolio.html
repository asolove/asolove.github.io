      <section class="project">
        <h3>React & Om Evangelization <time>2014</time></h3>
        <p>I was an early adopter of React and experimenter with ClojureScript and Om. I wrote the first <a href="http://www.adamsolove.com/js/clojure/2014/01/06/om-experience-report.html">blog post on using Om</a> after David Nolen announced it. I gave one of the first <a href="http://www.adamsolove.com/js/clojure/2014/05/08/react-js-and-om.html">talks on the core ideas of React and Om</a> at a time when React was very misunderstood.</p>
        <p>Two years ago I was playing with and outlining the philosophy behind the tools that are gaining traction now. <strong>Want to know what's we'll be doing two years from now? <a href="mailto:asolove+career@gmail.com">Let's talk.</a></strong></p>

        <h3>Constraint programming talk, JSConf <time>2013</time></h3>

        </aside>
        <p>I am very interested in how <strong>computers can extend rather than replace human thinking</strong>. Most user interfaces today rely on humans to provide input but then have computers make the actual decisions. Constraint programming is one model in which human decisions and computer logic can coexist to extend the limits of human thinking. In this talk, I explained the basics of constraint programming, show several basic examples, and speculate on the future of constraint interfaces.</p>

        </aside>
        <p>Ward Cunningham, the inventor of the wiki, is now exploring a major change to the idea, using a decentralized editing model similar to git. His project, Smallest federated wiki, had a solid API and a great interface concept, but some of the details of getting it to work in the browser had proved difficult to implement. I contributed my browser knowledge, starting with this browser history, animations, and scrolling work. My work <strong>made the interface more fluid and intuitive</strong>.</p>

        <h3><time>2014&ndash;2016</time> 
          Principal Engineer & Tech Lead,<br>
          Vistaprint Digital Marketing Products</h3>
        <p>I led three teams across several products and a new, service-oriented architecture to replace a legacy product framework.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Led the whitelabeling and integration of Rails and Node apps into a service-oriented ecosystem while continuing ongoing product development and support. Refactored old contracts into REST APIs, old user interfaces into modern JavaScript, and old user flows into more pleasant and measurable experiences.</li>
          <li>In self-directed projects, I worked across marketing, analytics, and product boundaries: identified 40% optimizations to paid search campaigns, quickly proved we could remove six months of work from one product's roadmap, and <strong>quadrupled a large product's repeat engagement in two days of work.</strong></li>
          <li>As a facilitator and agitator throughout the organization, I championed the adoption of modern UI tools and testing, created powerful new analytics to guide decisions, and conducted the company's first paper prototyping and design thinking sessions.</li>

        <h3>Founder, Snowdrop <time>2015</time></h3>
        <p>Currently in a private beta, Snowdrop is <strong>a mobile webapp that helps  families to fight post-partum depression</strong>. My family has struggled with post-partum depression and its aftermath since the birth of our first child. Through the recovery, we learned that while medication and therapy play an important role, we also had to develop new habits of thought, reflection, and communication. We've tried to turn those habits into a repeatable process and are currently experimenting with it. The software is built on Rails, Heroku and Twilio.</p>

        <h3>Webmaster, The Millennial Experience Mobile Exhibit <time>2015</time></h3>
        <aside>
          <a href="http://www.themillennialexperience.org/it/title-panel/"><img src="/img/me.png" width="100%"></a>
          <p>View the <a href="http://www.themillennialexperience.org/it/title-panel/"> archived site</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/millennial_one">some of the resulting responses.</a></p>
        </aside>
        <p>I built a mobile website to accompany an exhibit on millennials' existential questions that was displayed at Europe's largest summer festival, the Meeting at Rimini. With such an enormous audience, mostly using old Android phones on an over-crowded cell network, the site needed to be very fast to load. But it also needed to be fast to build and update in several languages, because the content was only available shortly before the exhibition began, and then changed rapidly.</p>
        <p>I used React as the site's foundation, providing me the convenience of working in JavaScript and its ecosystem of libraries, while still allowing the finished site to be burned out as static HTML with no client-side code.</p>
        <p><strong>Pages loaded in less than a second even on slow cell connections, but content could be updated across the site and deployed in seconds.</strong></p>

          UI Engineering Lead,<br>
          Webs (acquired by Vistaprint)</h3>
        <p>I led the team building a ground-breaking in-browser website editor and then white-labeling it into a larger service ecosystem.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Designed "The Frontend Amusement Park", a new common architecture for our UI work. It included tooling for MVC JavaScript, unit and simulation tests, modular dependencies, loadtime optimization, easy i18n, etc. It drastically reduced the time-to-market for new feature development while increasing quality.</li>
          <li>Recruited and mentored a team of front-end developers who knew best practices and loved to follow them because the tooling made it so fun to develop new UIs.</li>
          <li>The incredibly smooth new website editor was <strong>the demo that drove Webs' $118m acquisition</strong> by Vistaprint.</li>
          <li>Led a cross-functional renaissance that tore down the walls between front-end, back-end and quality. Championed the first project where REST APIs, UI work, and testing scenarios were developed by the same team, in sync. (This sounds less impressive than the others but believe me it was the hardest and the most important.)</li>

        <p>For several years I worked as a freelancer doing typesetting, web design, and development work for various clients. During that time I developed a strong distrust for my clients' descriptions of what they wanted. It was only when we got to visual representations that their opinions began to be consistent. Deco was an experimental online moodboarding tool where clients and I could work together to look for inspiration and agree on the meanings of the words they used.</p>
        <p>Built in 2010, Deco was a very early experiment in using Node.js, websockets, the html5 File API, and multitouch events.</p>
